      <description>This paper is still in the writing phase. Link to GitHub Repository.
Science &amp;amp; technology studies scholars have investigated on how race has been molecularized within scientific studies. And while existing research mainly leans on qualitative strategies such as ethnographies, interviews, and rigorous historical analysis, very little work to date has used social network analysis to study how racial difference is constructed in scientific literature. In this study, I use discourse analysis to first codify racialized claims in a sample of studies that test population differences in the hormone testosterone.</description>

While feminist science studies scholars have documented the misleading and dangerous implica-tions of reducing testosterone to a “sex hormone,” few studies have explored how testosterone is used to racialize populations in and beyond scientific research. In this article, I conduct a content analysis of 149 studies that evaluate population differences in testosterone. Despite widespread claims that testosterone varies between racial groups, my analysis of this literature provides scant evidence to support these proclamations, undermining the notion that testosterone contributes to racial differences in biomedical and biosocial outcomes.</description>

      <description>Brandon Kramer, PhD (they/them/he/him) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Social and Decision Analytics Division at the University of Virginia&amp;rsquo;s Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative. Generally, Brandon’s research interests lie at the intersection of science, technology, and health. While trained as a sociologist, Brandon incorporates aspects of science &amp;amp; technology studies, computational social science, and social neuroscience to examine social inequities across a number of domains. This work has been published in Science, Technology &amp;amp; Human Values, BioSocieties, Annals of Behavioral Medicine, and the Annual Review of Nutrition.</description>
