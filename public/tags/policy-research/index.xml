      <title>Measuring the Scope and Impact of Open-Source Software</title>

      <description>Current economic indicators and indicators developed by the National Center for Science &amp;amp; Engineering Statistics (NCSES) do not measure the value of goods and services that fall outside of market transactions. Although NCSES does track some types of software development, it is challenging to account for open source software (OSS) outputs because these products are largely being advanced outside of traditional business contexts. Moreover, while current measures of innovation tend to rely on survey data, patent issues, trademarks approvals, intangible asset data, or estimates of total factor productivity growth, these measures are either incomplete or fail to capture innovation that is freely available to the public.</description>

      <description>Pristavec. P., Kramer, B. L., &amp;amp; Goldstein, J. “Using Publically Available Data to Understand Neighborhood Change and Mitigate Gentrification: A Case Study from Fairfax County, VA.” [GitHub Repo]
  Gentrification refers to the process of areas experiencing an influx of affluent or college-educated residents and businesses, leading to displacement of long-term residents and vulnerable populations. Although research documents gentrification extensively, local governments often lack resources to detect its emergence and mitigate negative community impacts.</description>

      <description>Kramer, B., Weber, M. &amp;amp; Yanovitsky, I. Networks of Evidence Use in the Context of Federal Childhood Obesity Policymaking. In Progress. [GitHub Repo] [EPIK website]
Despite considerable interest in strategies for promoting evidence-informed policymaking, research that tracks and analyzes use of research evidence in public policymaking is scarce. We use social network analysis to trace the flow of research evidence in the context of childhood obesity legislation from 2000-2014. Network analysis is used to examine how political homophily, or policymakers’ shared group affiliations, and various structural characteristics of the policy network influence evidence exchange over this period.</description>
