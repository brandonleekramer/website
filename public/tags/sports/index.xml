      <description>Fantasy Basketball Background  Fantasy basketball is one of my favorite hobbies. I started playing in 2018 as a welcome distraction while writing my dissertation, and this expanded to a few leagues after graduating. While many people play fantasy for money, I try to limit it to a fun hobby where I get to meet people from around the world to chat about the NBA and many other interesting things.</description>
