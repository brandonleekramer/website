      <description>Kramer, B.L. (2020) “The Molecularization of Race in Testosterone Research.” BioSocieties. GitHub Repo.
While feminist science studies scholars have documented the misleading and dangerous implica-tions of reducing testosterone to a “sex hormone,” few studies have explored how testosterone is used to racialize populations in and beyond scientific research. In this article, I conduct a content analysis of 149 studies that evaluate population differences in testosterone. Despite widespread claims that testosterone varies between racial groups, my analysis of this literature provides scant evidence to support these proclamations, undermining the notion that testosterone contributes to racial differences in biomedical and biosocial outcomes.</description>

      <description>Carlin, L. &amp;amp; Kramer, B.L. (2020). “Hair, Hormones &amp;amp; Ghosts: How Race is Submerged in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.” Science, Technology &amp;amp; Human Values. (Impact Factor = 3.160).
In this paper, we examine how polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is racialized in biomedical research. Drawing from Star’s seminal concept of triangulation, we analyze how the diagnostic criteria for PCOS combine two different biomarkers: body hair and testosterone. Hair and hormones are both haunted by their use in eugenic research, and as clinical measures, they can carry forward powerful narratives of biological difference.</description>

      <description>Kramer, B.L., Himmelstein, M.S., &amp;amp; Springer, K.W. (2017). Getting to the heart of masculinity stressors: Masculinity threats induce pronounced vagal withdrawal during a speaking task. Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 51(6), 846-855. (Impact Factor = 3.118).
In this study, we use an experimental framework to fill three existing gaps in the masculinities and health literatures. First, we examine the impact of masculinity threats on cortisol reactivity to understand how hegemonic masculinity gets “under the skin” to affect men’s health.</description>
