<p>Hi, I am Brandon Kramer and I’m currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Virginia’s Biocomplexity Institute. Generally, I have a background researching ethics and inequality in science, tech, and health. While I am trained as a sociologist, I have spent the last two years working as an applied data science working with stakeholders from a number of industries to collect data, build models, and develop software that helps to address the concerns of diverse populations. I have a breadth of methodological skills, but I most enjoy working with natural language processing, social network anaylsis, and data visualizations to build tools that help address the dilemmas my colleagues and I are working to address. You can check out some of this work on my <a href="/publications/">publications</a> and <a href="/projects/">projects</a> pages.</p>

<h4>Current Research Projects</h4>
<p><strong>Open Source Software Development.</strong> Currently, I have two main research projects. In the first, I collaborate with a team of researchers at the University of Virginia, the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis studying the <a href="/projects/oss/">scope and impact of open-source software (OSS)</a>. Currently, the NCSES and other economic indicators do not have a strong gauge on the economic value of OSS. We set out to improve these evaluations by collecting and analyzing administrative data from OSS developers around the world. Over the past few years, our team has scraped user and activity data from millions of repositories on the world’s largest code hosting repository platform - GitHub. In the process, we have developed a number of our own OSS tools to study GitHub users, including <a href="https://github.com/brandonleekramer/tidyorgs">tidyorgs</a> - a software package that detects and standardizes organizations across academic, business, government, and nonprofit sectors - and <a href="https://github.com/brandonleekramer/diverstidy">diverstidy</a> - a package for working with geographic, population and other diversity-related terminology in unstandardized text data. While these tasks are important for understanding this emerging ecosystem, our primary objective is estimating the resource costs of developing OSS with the intention of including these estimates in the U.S. national accounts. My personal focus in this domain relates to studying international collaboration patterns with social network analysis and natural language processing. This work is forthcoming in the NCSES’s annual 2022 <em>Science and Engineering Indicators</em> report.</p>
<p><strong>Race and Diversity in Biomedical Research.</strong> In the second project, I study the use of race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and other forms of diversity in biomedical research. In my <a href="/projects/dissertation">dissertation project</a> (Rutgers University, 2019), I researched how testosterone has been used to racialize populations in biomedical research and the impact that this has on understanding health disparities. By integrating various computational and qualitative strategies, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41292-020-00200-w">I traced how testosterone researchers advance misleading and dangerous claims about racial differences in health and behavior</a>, ultimately arguing that these discourses contribute to racially-specific healthcare practices that exacerbate prostate cancer disparities between white and black men. Building on this foundation, I’ve joined with Catherine Lee (at Rutgers Sociology) to <a href="https://riseofdiversity.netlify.app/">study the use diversity in biomedical research more broadly</a> using computational text analysis and word embedding methods. In this project, we find that while sex/gender, lifecourse and the general concept of diversity is rising over time, racial and ethnics terms are actually on the decline. Moreover, our results also suggest that diversity is replacing the concept of race/ethnicity while simultaneously being used less often alongside social justice and inequality-related terminology.</p>
