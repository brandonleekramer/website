<p>Brandon Kramer, Ph.D. is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Social and Decision Analytics Division at the University of Virginia’s Biocomplexity Institute. Generally, I am interested in researching issues related to ethics and inequality at the intersection of science, technology, politics, and health. While formally trained as a sociologist, I use aspects of computational social science and science &amp; technology studies to address a range of social and policy concerns. My work has been published in the <em>Annual Review of Nutrition</em>, <em>Science, Technology &amp; Human Values</em>, <em>BioSocieties</em>, and <em>Annals of Behavioral Medicine</em>.</p>

<h4>Dissertation Research</h4>
<p>In my <a href="/projects/dissertation">dissertation project</a> (Rutgers University, 2019), I studied how testosterone has been used to racialize populations in biomedical research and the impact that this has on understanding health disparities. By integrating various computational and qualitative strategies, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41292-020-00200-w">I traced how testosterone researchers advance misleading and dangerous claims about racial differences in health and behavior</a>, ultimately arguing that these discourses contribute to racially-specific healthcare practices that exacerbate prostate cancer disparities between white and black men. As part of this ongoing research, I am developing a project that uses natural language processing, machine learning, and network analysis to <a href="https://growthofdiversity.netlify.app/">study diversity in biomedical research more broadly</a>.</p>

<h4>Collaborative Research</h4>
<p>In my present role at the UVA Biocomplexity Institute, I spend most of his time working in a multidisciplinary team science environment. Since graduating, Brandon has worked on collaborative projects - both in and outside of UVA - that examine <a href="/projects/oss/">international collaboration networks in open-source software development</a>, <a href="/projects/impacts-and-echoes/">the political history of nutrition science</a>, <a href="/projects/diversity/">the rise of “diversity” in biomedical research</a>, <a href="/projects/gentrification/">the use of predictive modeling to evaluate risk of gentrification and emerging employment areas</a>, and <a href="https://dspgtools.shinyapps.io/EM-Data-Infrastructure/">a project investing how built infrastructure shapes economic mobility across three states</a>. I have experience in network/graph analysis, natural language processing, regression, probabalistic record linkage, data visualization, geospatial mapping, survey design and implementation, as well as a number of qualitative strategies like content/discourse analysis and interviewing.</p>
<p>Before moving to Biocomplexity, I collaborated with several research groups in graduate school. Using an experimental framework, my colleagues Kristen Springer (Rutgers), Mary Himmelstein (Kent State) and I studied how masculinity threats impact young men’s biological stress reactivity as well as the impact that this may have gendered disparities in health outcomes. During this project, I became interested in how scientific practices and technologies shape biomedical knowledge production. To supplement this biosocial training, I worked under Guggenheim fellows Rebecca Jordan-Young (Barnard) and Katrina Karkazis (Amherst), getting exposure to qualitative methods like interviews and content analysis as well as feminist and critical race frameworks, while contributing as a research fellow for their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Testosterone-Unauthorized-Biography-Rebecca-Jordan-Young/dp/067472532">National Science Foundation-funded book project on testosterone</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, I collaborated on a William T. Grant-supported project working with Matthew Weber (Minnesota) and Itzhak Yanovitzky (Rutgers) on a project that applied statistical and inferential social network analysis to examine policymakers’ use of evidence in the context of childhood obesity legislation. Finally, I served as a research fellow on a National Institute of Drug Abuse-funded project with Kathryn Greene (Rutgers) and Michael Hecht (Real Prevention LLC) testing an interactive technology-based substance use intervention. Overall, this breadth of work shows that I can draw on a range of qualitative and computational tools to address research questions at the intersection of science, technology, policy, and health.
