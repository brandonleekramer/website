Hi, I am Brandon Kramer and I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Social and Decision Analytics Division at the University of Virginia's Biocomplexity Institute. Generally, I research innovation and inequality at the intersection of science, technology, and health. While formally trained as a sociologist, I use computational social science and science & technology studies to study a range of social and policy concerns. My work has been published in the *Annual Review of Nutrition*, *Science, Technology & Human Values*, *BioSocieties*, and *Annals of Behavioral Medicine*. My computation skills include network/graph analytics, natural language processing, predictive analytics, probabalistic record linkage, data visualization, geospatial mapping, survey design and implementation, experiments, as well as a number of qualitative strategies like content/discourse analysis and interviewing. 

#### Current Research  

**Open Source Software Development.** Currently, I have two main research projects. In the first, I collaborate with a team of researchers at the University of Virginia, the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis studying the [scope and impact of open-source software (OSS)](/projects/oss/). Currently, the NCSES and other economic indicators do not have a strong gauge on the economic value of OSS. We set out to improve these evaluations by collecting and analyzing administrative data from OSS developers around the world. Over the past few years, our team has scraped user and activity data from millions of repositories on the world's largest code hosting repository platform - GitHub. In the process, we have developed a number of our own OSS tools to study GitHub users, including by examining which economic sectors, organizations, and geographic areas that they come from and what types of software they develop. While these tasks are important for understanding this emerging ecosystem, our primary objective is estimating the resource costs of developing OSS with the intention of including these estimates in the U.S. national accounts. My personal focus in this domain relates to studying international collaboration patterns with social network analysis and natural language processing. This work is forthcoming in the NCSES's annual 2022 *Science and Engineering Indicators* report.

**Race and Diversity in Biomedical Research.** In the second project, I study the use of race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and other forms of 'diversity' in biomedical research. In my [dissertation project](/projects/dissertation) (Rutgers University, 2019), I researched how testosterone has been used to racialize populations in biomedical research and the impact that this has on understanding health disparities. By integrating various computational and qualitative strategies, [I traced how testosterone researchers advance misleading and dangerous claims about racial differences in health and behavior](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41292-020-00200-w), ultimately arguing that these discourses contribute to racially-specific healthcare practices that exacerbate prostate cancer disparities between white and black men. Building on this foundation, I've joined with Catherine Lee (at Rutgers Sociology) to [study the use diversity in biomedical research more broadly](https://riseofdiversity.netlify.app/) using computational text analysis and word embedding methods. In this project, we find that while sex/gender, lifecourse and the general concept of diversity is rising over time, racial and ethnics terms are actually on the decline. Moreover, our results also suggest that diversity is replacing the concept of race/ethnicity while simultaneously being used less often alongside social justice and inequality-related terminology. 

#### Other Collaborative Research 

In my present role at the UVA Biocomplexity Institute, I spend most of his time working in a multidisciplinary team science environment. Since graduating, Brandon has worked on collaborative projects - both in and outside of UVA - that examine [international collaboration networks in open-source software development](/projects/oss/), [the political history of nutrition science](/projects/impacts-and-echoes/), [the rise of "diversity" in biomedical research](/projects/diversity/), [the use of predictive modeling to evaluate risk of gentrification and emerging employment areas](/projects/gentrification/), and [a project investing how built infrastructure shapes economic mobility across three states](https://dspgtools.shinyapps.io/EM-Data-Infrastructure/). In the Fall of 2021, I will start collobating as key personnal on a multi-institutional team project that address environmental precarity and saltwater desalination on the Eastern Virginian shores. 

Before moving to Biocomplexity, I collaborated with several research groups in graduate school. Using an experimental framework, my colleagues Kristen Springer (Rutgers), Mary Himmelstein (Kent State) and I studied how masculinity threats impact young men's biological stress reactivity as well as the impact that this may have gendered disparities in health outcomes. During this project, I became interested in how scientific practices and technologies shape biomedical knowledge production. To supplement this biosocial training, I worked under Guggenheim fellows Rebecca Jordan-Young (Barnard) and Katrina Karkazis (Amherst), getting exposure to qualitative methods like interviews and content analysis as well as feminist and critical race frameworks, while contributing as a research fellow for their [National Science Foundation-funded book project on testosterone](https://www.amazon.com/Testosterone-Unauthorized-Biography-Rebecca-Jordan-Young/dp/067472532). 

Shortly after this, I collaborated on a William T. Grant-supported project working with Matthew Weber and Itzhak Yanovitzky (Rutgers) on a project that applied statistical and inferential social network analysis to examine policymakersâ€™ use of evidence in the context of childhood obesity legislation. Finally, I served as a research fellow on a National Institute of Drug Abuse-funded project with Kathryn Greene (Rutgers) and Michael Hecht (Real Prevention LLC) testing an interactive technology-based substance use intervention. Overall, this breadth of work shows that I can draw on a range of qualitative and computational tools to address research questions at the intersection of science, technology, policy, and health.
