#### 

Hi, my name is Brandon Kramer and I'm a computational social scientist based at the University of Virginia's Biocomplexity Institute. While my background is in sociology, I meld insights from data science, economics, and design to research innovation and ethics in science and tech. In my current role, I mostly collaborate with federal policymakers to address a range of social and economic problems they face - my favorite being a project that analyses the global scope and impact of open-source software. I am currently looking to transition from academia to a role as a data scientist or UX researcher in an organization that cultivates equitable social and technical systems. I have a breadth of methodological skills, including survey design and dissemintation, big data analytics, software development, social network anaylsis, natural language processing, and data visualization. You can check out some of this work on my [publications](/publications/) and/or [projects](/projects/) pages. 

#### Current Research Projects 

*Open Source Software Development.* Currently, I have two main research projects. In the first, I collaborate with a team of researchers at the University of Virginia, the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis studying the [scope and impact of open-source software (OSS)](https://opensourcesoftware.netlify.app/packages/). Currently, the NCSES and other economic indicators do not have a strong gauge on the economic value of OSS. We set out to improve these evaluations by collecting and analyzing administrative data from OSS developers around the world. Over the past few years, our team has scraped user and activity data from millions of repositories on the world's largest code hosting repository platform - GitHub. In the process, we have developed a number of our own OSS tools to study GitHub users, including [tidyorgs](https://github.com/brandonleekramer/tidyorgs), [diverstidy](https://github.com/brandonleekramer/diverstidy), and [GHOST.jl](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/GHOST.jl) to help make sense of the OSS world. While these tasks are important for understanding this emerging ecosystem, our primary objective is estimating the resource costs of developing OSS with the intention of including these estimates in the U.S. national accounts. My personal focus in this domain relates to studying international collaboration patterns with social network analysis and natural language processing. This work is forthcoming in the NCSES's annual 2022 *Science and Engineering Indicators* report.

*Race and Diversity in Biomedical Research.* In the second project, I study the use of race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and other forms of diversity in biomedical research. In my [dissertation project](/projects/dissertation), I researched how testosterone has been used to racialize populations in biomedical research and the impact that this has on understanding health disparities. By integrating various computational and qualitative strategies, [I traced how testosterone researchers advance misleading and dangerous claims about racial differences in health and behavior](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41292-020-00200-w), ultimately arguing that these discourses contribute to racially-specific healthcare practices that exacerbate prostate cancer disparities between white and black men. Building on this foundation, I've collaborated with Catherine Lee (at Rutgers Sociology) to [study the use diversity in biomedical research more broadly](https://riseofdiversity.netlify.app/) using computational text analysis and word embedding methods. In this project, we find that while sex/gender, lifecourse and the general concept of diversity is rising over time, racial and ethnics terms are actually on the decline. Moreover, our results also suggest that diversity is replacing the concept of race/ethnicity while simultaneously being used less often alongside social justice and inequality-related terminology.
