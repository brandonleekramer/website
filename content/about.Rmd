Hi, my name is Brandon Kramer and I'm a User Experience (UX) Researcher at [Edge & Node](https://edgeandnode.com/) and [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) protocol. While I was formally trained as a sociologist, I used my background to advance decentralized technologies in the blockchain industry. During my academic career, I incorporated aspects of data science, science & technology studies, philosophy, economics, and design to study innovation and ethics in science, tech, and health. As my [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages detail, my main focus during graduate school was the conceptualization of sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and diversity in biomedical research. Later, as a postdoc at the University of Virginia, I worked on a team that studied the scope and impact of open-source software, which materialized into an interest in the blockchain industry. At Edge & Node, I now work on the design team working to improve the usability of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) - an open-source API designed to efficiently query, index, and store data from across multiple blockchains in a decentralized manner. Over the course of my career, I have acquired a breadth of methodological skills, including survey design and dissemination, big data analytics, software development, social network analysis, natural language processing, and data visualization. I obtained a Ph.D. in Sociology from Rutgers University in 2019 and previously held research positions at the University of Iowa, Rutgers University, Barnard College, and the University of Virginia.
