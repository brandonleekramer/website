**Brandon Kramer, PhD** (they/he) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Social and Decision Analytics Division at the University of Virginia's Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative. Generally, Brandonâ€™s research interests lie at the intersection of science, technology, and health. While trained as a sociologist, Brandon incorporates aspects of science & technology studies, computational social science, and social neuroscience to examine racial and gender inequities. This work has been published in *Science, Technology & Human Values*, *Annals of Behavioral Medicine*, and *Psychology of Men & Masculinity*.

In their [dissertation project](/projects/racialization-in-testosterone-research) (completed in Spring 2019 at Rutgers University), Brandon studied how testosterone has been used to racialize populations in biomedical research and the effect that this process has had on the construction of racial health disparities. By integrating various qualitative strategies with network analysis, Brandon traced how testosterone researchers advance misleading and dangerous claims about racial differences in health and behavior, ultimately arguing that these discourses contribute to racially-specific healthcare practices that exacerbate prostate cancer disparities between white and black men. As part of their ongoing research, Brandon is developing a project that uses natural language processing, machine learning, and network analysis to study the diffusion of racialized claims in biomedical research more broadly.

In addition to their sole-authored work, Brandon spends most of his time working on multidisciplinary team science projects. Since graduating, Brandon has worked on collaborative projects - both in and outside of UVA - that focus on the political history of nutrition science, the rise of "diversity" in biomedical research, international collaboration networks in open-source software development, and evidence sharing in federal policy contexts, the use of machine learning to predict gentrification, and interactive visualizations to shape local policy discussions on economic mobility.

Brandon also spent ten years racing go-karts when we was younger - winning five national championships, five regional championships, and more than 70 races along the way.
