<p>Over the past five years, I have taught and mentored in a variety of contexts, but my experience is a bit unconventional from most social scientists. During my time at Rutgers University, I was an Instructor for the <em>Sociology of Medicine and Health Care</em> for two semesters (Spring-Fall 2017) as well as a teaching assistant for <em>Contemporary Sociological Theory</em> (Spring 2016) and <em>Introduction to Sociological Research Methods</em> (Fall 2016). For my first four years at Rutgers (2012-2016), I also acted as Lab Manager in a research lab where I co-mentored more than 20 undergraduate students - with more than half of those students moving on to postgraduate or medical school after working with us. During this time, I trained students how to carry out behavioral experiments and clean cardiovascular data. Below is a training series detailing these procedures (see video series).</p>

<h5><ins><strong>University of Virginia - Biocomplexity Institute</strong></ins></h5>
<p>Over the past two years (July 2019-Present), Iâ€™ve been working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Virginia. In my division, we do not have teaching responsibilities during the academic year, but we do host a summer program called <a href="https://datascienceforthepublicgood.org/events/symposium2020">Data Science for the Public Good</a> (DSPG). Over the past three summers, our team has trained nearly 100 undergraduate and graduate students how to use data science to address a range of social and political issues defined by local and federal stakeholders. I personally have worked on 7 different teams over the past few years - leading one each of the past two summers. Below are some examples of the work my teams have produced.</p>
